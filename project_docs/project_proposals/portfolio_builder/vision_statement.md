# "My Portfolio"
"My Portfolio" allows you to build a professional website that showcases your projects for future employers within minutes. 

1. Use templated "blocks" to quickly construct nice looking portfolio website
2. Use chatgpt to help generate text for your blocks
3. Share your custom domain to allow people to easily view your projects

## Why
As someone who has begun applying to hundreds of internships and graduate jobs, I needed to create a portfolio quickly.
I used Wix, and found that it was overly complex for what I needed it to do, and it took me way to long to create a simple website that works on web and mobile.

I wish I had a tool that allowed me to showcase my projects quickly and not worry about styling, making it work on mobile, and having all the features I need.
