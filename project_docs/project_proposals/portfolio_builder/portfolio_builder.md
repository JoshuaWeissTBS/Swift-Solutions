# A portfolio builder targeted for students.

Imagine you could easily and quickly create a portfolio website that showcases your projects, skills, and experience, without writing any code, that could be easily shared to employers.

## Features:
-   Create a portfolio website in minutes
-   Choose from a variety of themes and layouts/blocks
-   Add your projects, skills, and experience, links to your social media, and more
-   Customize your website with your own domain name or domain name extension, colors, and more

## How it works:
Your portfolio will be built in chunks, called "blocks". Each block will be a section of your website, such as a project, skill, or experience. You can add as many blocks as you want top to bottom, and you can customize each block to your liking. For example, you can add a project block, and customize it to show your project's name, description, images, link, etc. There will be clean ui, using left and right arrows to select and swipe between different blocks.

## Potential external APIs:
- Github api to fetch projects
- LinkedIn api to fetch experience, skills, etc.
- ChatGPT to generate text for your website descriptions, titles, etc.
- PDF generator to generate a pdf version of your portfolio
- Instagram api to fetch images

## Potential revenue streams:
- Premium themes
- Premium features
- Premium blocks
- Premium domain names

## Competitors:
1. Website builders - Wix, Squarespace, etc. - These are too general and target general website building, and not targeted for students and portfolios specifically, and they are not free.
2. Portfolio builders - Adobe Portfolio, etc. - These are targeted for portfolios, but they are not free, and they take longer to create.
