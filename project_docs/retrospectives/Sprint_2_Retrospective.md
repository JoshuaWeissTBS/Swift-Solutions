# Sprint 2 Retrospective #

## Milestones: ##
- We got the Favorites page set up and accessible
- Users can get notified about events they have an interest in
- Users can search for events in other locations
- Our map of events is more user-friendly
- We improved our layouts and styling

## Loved: ##
- I definitely loved using templates and modules with the pages and javascript
- We had less dependencies on others' work
- We had some improvements in communication across work

## Loathed: ##
- We didn't write good acceptance criteria in our user stories
- We didn't plan ahead enough in what we wanted our user stories to do
- We underestimated the depth of some of our work

## Learned: ##
- We learned that we need to spend more time in the Sprint Planning
- We need to hold more meetings to touch base with where everyone's at
- We failed to reach out for help when we ran into issues

## Longed For: ##
- More communication
- Longer Sprint Planning and Research

## Actions: ##
- Once a day, we ask the team if and when they're available for a meeting to touch base. Aim for 8PM usually.
- We don't leave the Sprint Planning meeting until everyone is confident in their user stories, and everyone has read the user stories.
