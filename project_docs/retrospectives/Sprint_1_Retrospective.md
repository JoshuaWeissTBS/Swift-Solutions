# Sprint 1 Retrospective #

## Milestones: ##
- We've got a website
- We can create and log into our accounts
- Got Google Maps working
- Integrated our APIs

## Loved: ##
- I loved knowing what the boundaries of my work was
- I loved our styling and layout, the theme we created
- I loved the map feature, how smoothly it just worked

## Loathed: ##
- The work load seemed like a lot for just one person
- Having to wait for someone else to finish before working on something
- Didn't get the full scope of what the styling was supposed to be like done

## Learned: ##
- Got to stop making things bigger than they are with my user stories
- Need to stay within the scope of my user stories and not touch others'
- Sometimes we need to broaden our user stories if they're well within abilities
- Need to reinforce naming conventions

## Longed For: ##
- More styling guidelines
- More feedback from the team members about each others' work
- Giving feedback and review pull requests, more eyes on the process
- Easier Microsoft documentation for Identity

## Actions: ##
- To address the unclearness of the styling guidelines, we can create a dedicated page as a guideline with examples of HTML components and their CSS classes. This can be referenced later on by each member as we work on separate features to create a cohesive site theme.

- To combat having to wait for someone to finish work to do your own work, we can delay things that rely on other things being done to later sprints, or assign them to the same person.

- To enhance our boundaries of our work, we will work on better user stories, with a minimum of two acceptance criteria, a description of what the feature should be, and a rough guideline of how we expect to accomplish it.
